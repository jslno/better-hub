# Better Hub

Re-imagining code collaboration — a better place to collaborate on code, for humans and agents.

## Why

At Better Auth, we spend a lot of our time on GitHub. So we decided to build the experience we actually wanted. Better Hub improves everything from the home page to repo overview, PR reviews, and AI integration — faster and more pleasant overall.

It's not a GitHub replacement (maybe in the future 👀). It's a layer on top that makes the things you do every day feel better: reviewing PRs, triaging issues, navigating code, and collaborating with your team. With keyboard-first navigation, a built-in AI assistant (Ghost), and more agnetic features.

## Features

- **Repo overview** — cleaner layout with README rendering, file tree, activity feed
- **PR reviews** — inline diffs, AI-powered summaries, review comments
- **Issue management** — triage, filter, and act on issues faster
- **Ghost (AI assistant)** — review PRs, navigate code, triage issues, write commit messages (`⌘I` to toggle)
- **Command center** — search repos, switch themes, navigate anywhere (`⌘K`)x
- **CI/CD status** — view workflow runs and compare across branches
- **Security advisories** — track vulnerabilities per repo
- **Keyboard-first** — most actions accessible via shortcuts
- **Chrome extension** — adds a "Open in Better Hub" button on GitHub pages
